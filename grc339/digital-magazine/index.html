               <p>
               The awe-inspiring vastness of the open road, a crisp wind whipping at your hair through the open window, sights you’ve only dreamed of seeing—these are all quintessential pieces of a cross-country road trip. They aren’t, however, the only pieces.

                  <h3>How To Turn Your Guest House Into An AirBnB</h3>
                  <p>
                     Having a guest house on your property can be a great way to earn extra money. Although leasing it to a long-term tenant can provide a steady stream of income, the house may not be available for your guests when you need it. Listing your guest house on Airbnb can give you the best of both worlds.

                  <p>
                     Is it rude to call Nashville "South, Lite"? You won't find cowboys, just cowboy boots. Honky tonks, but the ones where they don't expect you to know the line dances. Southern food, but the James-Beard-award-winning kind. Get a taste over a long weekend and you might just want to move to this growing city that somehow still feels like a small town.
