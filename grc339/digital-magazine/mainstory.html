            <h2>Cross-Country With AirBnB</h2>
            <p>Road trips have always been part of America’s DNA, and despite skyrocketing gas prices, there’s still never been a better time to see just what those amber waves of grain are all about. For many of us, remote work has left the door wide open for new methods (and longer timelines) for exploration.</p>
            <p>Whether by RV, camper van, rental car, or whatever trusted chariot you’ve got sitting out in the driveway, pulling off a cross-country road trip is incredibly rewarding—but it does take work. Get a little help from those who’ve blazed the trail before you: From trip planning to money-saving, here are some tips I’ve picked up along the road.</p>

            <p>Arguably the most important part of planning a cross-country roadtrip is deciding how to get from coast to coast. You’ll hear people talk about the “north” route, I-90 from Boston to Seattle, or the “south” route, I-10 from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. Personally I don’t like having to choose, so our road trip route incorporated a little bit of both.
               The most important thing is to design the road trip around what inspires you. For me, that meant Badlands National Park, Glacier National Park, the Colorado Rockies, and the Southwest—which dictated that we drive the northern route until northwestern Montana, and then pivot straight south through Wyoming and Colorado before turning west again and taking the southern route.
            </p>
            <p>Start by making a list in Google Maps of all the places you want to see. You may be surprised at how naturally a route forms. You also may be surprised at how little time it actually takes to get from one place to the next. Did you know it’s only a 10-hour drive from New York to Detroit?
               A great resource is the book Road Trip USA, which highlights the country’s most scenic two-lane highways. Sometimes following an itinerary that is already crafted for you takes a lot of the guesswork out, which many people prefer. Everyone's tolerance for driving is different, too; you'll need to gauge your threshold. Don't plan to cross the country in six days if you can only handle four hours of driving at a time.

            <p>Part of the adventure of a cross-country road trip is leaving room for improvisation. We don't book our hotels until the day of, which is great because we can be on our own timetable. But this can become an issue around the national parks, where hotels can often be booked months in advance.
               As badly as you want to see Yellowstone and Zion, well... so does everyone else in America. It’s vitally important to plan ahead and know what each park’s entry restrictions are. Consider springing for the $80 annual pass, which provides access to all the national parks as many times as you want in a 12-month period.

               Probably the second most important factor of the Great American Road Trip is actually being able to fund it. While you’re certainly saving money on flights, road trips are not exactly cheap. Knowing your budget—and sticking to it—is key. AirBnB is your go-to resource for unique stays throughout your venture across the country. From a cozy cabin in the woods to a sunny beach house on the shore, AirBnB has you covered.
